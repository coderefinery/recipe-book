# Penne all'arrabbiata

## Ingredients
- Cayenne pepper – The larger the chilli, the less spicy they are! So cayenne peppers are not super spicy. Though, I do like to keep the seeds in for an extra zing of spiciness (the seeds is where most of the spiciness is). Feel free to de-seed if you prefer, or just use dried chillis (see note above photo for why I use fresh and dried).

- Feel brave? Use Birds Eye or Thai chillies instead! They pack more spiciness than cayenne peppers.

- Dried red chillis – These have a warm earthiness that fresh chillis do not. Sauteing with garlic brings out the toasty flavour as well as the spiciness. 

- Pasta type – Traditionally made with penne, though ziti is a direct replacement (it’s penne with a smooth surface). Though really, you can make this with any short or long pasta.

- Canned crushed tomato – To be authentic, use whole peeled tomatoes (canned) and mash them up with a fork. For convenience, I use crushed tomatoes! 

- Sourness note: Not all canned tomatoes are created equal! Economical brands tend to be more sour. Take the edge off with ½ teaspoon of sugar. 

- Garlic – 3 cloves! Arrabiata sauce is meant to have a nice hit of garlic flavour.

- Parmesan – For serving.

- Parsley – For optional garnish.

## Procedure

1. Cook pasta: penne or other desired pasta. Drain and set aside.

2. Make the arrabbiata sauce.  Add oil, garlic, and crushed red pepper to a skillet over medium heat and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the whole tomatoes, tomato paste, and simmer for 10 minutes before removing from heat and adding the fresh basil.
